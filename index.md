# Support Group

A support group is hosted in Huntsville, and meets several times per month. We
welcome all adult transgender and non-binary identifying people regardless of
their physical or social state of transition.

Group meetings are an opportunity for members to discuss whatever is on their
mind, as well as providing a safe space to explore gender expression without
fear of judgement.

Group membership is kept confidential, and measures are taken to preserve privacy
and avoid outing people.

To help ensure the privacy and safety of the group, exact meeting details are not
publicly available. If you would like more information please contact Alek 
Mitterbach on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mitterbach),
[Email](mailto:membership@trans-north-alabama.org) or by phone/text
([(216) 533-1660](tel:216-533-1660)).
