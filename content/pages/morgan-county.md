# Morgan County Name Change Process

Note: This process applies to people aged 19+. Those 18 and under have a completely
different set of rules.

This process is expected to take anywhere from 6-10 weeks before you can obtain
the court order, so start accordingly. Add another 4 weeks before you have an
updated ID.

[Here is the official Morgan County Name Change Guidelines][official]. It is a
good reference to have, however it is incorrect and incomplete compared to how
the process actually works. Calling the office also doesn’t help as the staff
might not give the most accurate information over the phone.

**Documents required when filing the name change petition:**

- Unexpired driver’s license or government issued photo ID
- Social Security card
- Certified copy of your birth certificate
- Morgan County lease/deed if your address on ID isn’t correct
- ALEA background check
- FBI background check
- Petition to the court (PS-12)

## Preparing prerequisites

At the Decatur police department you will need to obtain 2 copies of your
fingerprints on FBI Blue Cards. This service is free.

Print these forms:

- [ALEA background check][ALEA]: The application is the first page. Pages 3 and 4 are instructions
- [FBI background check][FBI]

Fill out the forms, get them notarized (if needed), include necessary fees,
paperwork, and the fingerprints. Then send in the forms. ALEA takes around 4-6
weeks and the FBI takes 6-8 weeks.

Note: If your address on your ID is not correct, don’t worry. Just make sure to
bring a copy of your lease or deed to certify that you live in Morgan County.

Once you receive your background checks back from ALEA and the FBI you can
continue with the process.

## Filing for the name change

Next, [print a petition to the court][PS-12]. Fill out the blanks then print
and sign. It must be notarized.

Gather all your paperwork from the list at the beginning of this guide. Every
document listed is required.

Note: The probate office does not accept debit or credit cards when paying filing fees. It
is highly advisable to bring cash with you, but if you forget, they do have an
ATM downstairs in the café with a high fee. They published that the filing fee
is $22 but “subject to change”.

Turn in everything at the probate office on the 2nd floor of the Morgan County
Courthouse. Pay your fee and they will call you when it is processed and ready
to pick up. This should only take a few days.

Once you get the call you can go pick up the court order. Its highly advised to
get multiple copies of your court order while you are picking it up, so bring
some cash for this purpose.

Note: This guide is written from the perspective of someone without any
criminal background.  Name changes have been difficult to obtain with a record
from the experience of the local community. It is highly advisable that you
consult with an attorney if you are seeing a legal name change with prior
criminal history.
