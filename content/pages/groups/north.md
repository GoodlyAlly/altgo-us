These groups all meet in Huntsville, but many people from the surrounding
communities (Madison, Athens, Decatur, etc.) are members of the groups as well.

# Transgender North Alabama - Adult Support Group (18+)

This group is hosted in Huntsville, and meets several times per month. We
welcome all adult transgender and non-binary identifying people regardless of
their physical or social state of transition.

Group meetings are an opportunity for members to discuss whatever is on their
mind, as well as providing a safe space to explore gender expression without
fear of judgement.

Group membership is kept confidential, and measures are taken to preserve privacy
and avoid outing people.

To help ensure the privacy and safety of the group, exact meeting details are
not publicly available. If you would like more information please [send us an
email](mailto:membership@altgo.us) or join the [Discord
group](https://discord.gg/3a9uxjwvbd).

group members.
