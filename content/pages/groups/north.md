# Transgender North Alabama - Adult Support Group (18+)

<img src="/extra_static/trans_north_al_logo.png" width="500" />

This group is hosted in Huntsville, and meets several times per month. We
welcome all adult transgender and non-binary identifying people regardless of
their physical or social state of transition. You must also be 18 or older to
attend.

Group meetings are an opportunity for members to discuss whatever is on their
mind, as well as providing a safe space to explore gender expression without
fear of judgement.

Group membership is kept confidential, and measures are taken to preserve privacy
and avoid outing people.

To help ensure the privacy and safety of the group, exact meeting details are
not publicly available. If you would like more information please [send us an
email](mailto:membership@altgo.us) or join the [Discord
group](https://discord.gg/3a9uxjwvbd) or call [(256)
469-3453](tel:256-469-3453).

**Note for group members:** We are currently following CDC guidelines for all
in-person support group meetings. In particular, this means if the Madison
county COVID-19 Community Level is "High", masks are required for anyone
attending the group. At "Medium" or "Low" masks are optional, but you are
always free to wear a mask to group if you wish.

Counseling Center to join and will be informed of the meeting dates, time and

group members.

# Mid-Life Transgender Support Group

Our trans-led peer support group is open to people in mid-life or later. Our
support group provides a safe space for people who are transgender, gender
non-conforming, and their significant family members. We provide a place to
come together to support one another, as we work though the challenges of
gender dysphoria. Those of us in mid-life may be married, may be in mid-career,
may be a business owner, and may have children (and grandchildren). Our
circumstances and life experiences set up apart from younger transgender
people. This support group is also a good place to come to get information and
referrals for other services you may need. There is no cost to attend our
support group.

If you are interested in attending our support group, please contact Colleen at
[Colleen.Marie@outlook.com](mailto:Colleen.Marie@outlook.com), or by mobile
phone at [256-434-1850](tel:256-434-1850) or Jimmie at
[jgwilliams1800@aol.com](mailto:jgwilliams1800@aol.com).
