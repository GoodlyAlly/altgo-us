# Transgender North Alabama - Adult Support Group (18+)

<img src="/extra_static/trans_north_al_logo.png" width="500" />

This group is hosted in Huntsville, and meets several times per month. We
welcome all adult transgender and non-binary identifying people regardless of
their physical or social state of transition.

Group meetings are an opportunity for members to discuss whatever is on their
mind, as well as providing a safe space to explore gender expression without
fear of judgement.

Group membership is kept confidential, and measures are taken to preserve privacy
and avoid outing people.

To help ensure the privacy and safety of the group, exact meeting details are
not publicly available. If you would like more information please [send us an
email](mailto:membership@altgo.us) or join the [Discord
group](https://discord.gg/3a9uxjwvbd) or call [(256)
469-3453](tel:256-469-3453).

**Note for group members:** We are currently following CDC guidelines for all
in-person support group meetings. In particular, this means if the Madison
county COVID-19 Community Level is "High", masks are required for anyone
attending the group. At "Medium" or "Low" masks are optional, but you are
always free to wear a mask to group if you wish.
