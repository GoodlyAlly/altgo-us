# ALTRAC - Political Action Group

The Alabama Trans Rights Action Coalition is an entirely volunteer-run
organization founded in Alabama. Its mission is to build a better future for
queer and transgender people in Alabama by creating resources and tools to help
people be engaged politically and to effectively connect with their
legislators.
